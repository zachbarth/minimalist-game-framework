# Minimalist Game Framework #

This is a minimalist game framework in the style of the "game engine" we use at [Zachtronics](http://www.zachtronics.com). It is a thin layer over [SDL2](http://wiki.libsdl.org/FrontPage) that encourages you to modify and extend the framework to suit your needs and preferences.

# Getting Started #

1. Clone the repo.
2. Add your assets (images, fonts, sounds, and music) to the Assets folder. These files will be automatically synchronized to your build directory by a post-build step in Visual Studio.
3. Start writing your game in the `Game` class.

All functions and properties listed below are members of the static `Engine` class. For example, if you wanted to draw a line, you could call `Engine.DrawLine()` from anywhere in your code. Documentation for function arguments and enum values can be found in the code itself.

# Example #

![Resizable Textures Example](Docs/example-game.gif)

```C#
class Game
{
    public static readonly string Title = "Minimalist Game Framework";
    public static readonly Vector2 Resolution = new Vector2(128, 128);

    // Define some constants controlling animation speed:
    static readonly float Framerate = 10;
    static readonly float WalkSpeed = 50;

    // Load some textures when the game starts:
    Texture texKnight = Engine.LoadTexture("knight.png");
    Texture texBackground = Engine.LoadTexture("background.png");

    // Keep track of the knight's state:
    Vector2 knightPosition = Resolution / 2;
    bool knightFaceLeft = false;
    float knightFrameIndex = 0;

    public Game()
    {
    }

    public void Update()
    {
        // Draw the background:
        Engine.DrawTexture(texBackground, Vector2.Zero);

        // Use the keyboard to control the knight:
        Vector2 moveOffset = Vector2.Zero;
        if (Engine.GetKeyHeld(Key.Left))
        {
            moveOffset.X -= 1;
            knightFaceLeft = true;
        }
        if (Engine.GetKeyHeld(Key.Right))
        {
            moveOffset.X += 1;
            knightFaceLeft = false;
        }
        if (Engine.GetKeyHeld(Key.Up))
        {
            moveOffset.Y -= 1;
        }
        if (Engine.GetKeyHeld(Key.Down))
        {
            moveOffset.Y += 1;
        }
        knightPosition += moveOffset * WalkSpeed * Engine.TimeDelta;

        // Advance through the knight's 6-frame animation and select the current frame:
        knightFrameIndex = (knightFrameIndex + Engine.TimeDelta * Framerate) % 6.0f;
        bool knightIdle = moveOffset.Length() == 0;
        Bounds2 knightFrameBounds = new Bounds2(((int)knightFrameIndex) * 16, knightIdle ? 0 : 16, 16, 16);

        // Draw the knight:
        Vector2 knightDrawPos = knightPosition + new Vector2(-8, -8);
        TextureMirror knightMirror = knightFaceLeft ? TextureMirror.Horizontal : TextureMirror.None;
        Engine.DrawTexture(texKnight, knightDrawPos, source: knightFrameBounds, mirror: knightMirror);
    }
}
```

class **`Color`**

* A data structure representing a 32-bit RGBA color that is used in many API functions. 
* The class also contains static members for all of the built-in .NET colors, e.g. `Color.CornflowerBlue` and others.

# Appendix 1: Screen Resolution #

To keep things simple, the resolution of the game is fixed and specified at the top of the `Game` class. 

If you hit Alt+Enter while the game is running it will toggle between windowed and fullscreen.
* When running windowed the window will be the same size as the specified resolution. 
* When running fullscreen the game will scale up to fit your screen and automatically letterbox if the aspect ratios do not match (so that the contents are not distorted).

# Appendix 2: Resizable Textures #

Most of the asset types supported should be fairly obvious, but the framework also supports something ambiguously called a "resizable texture". Sometimes also called "nine-patches" or "border textures", these are textures that are divided into nine areas (specified at load time as numerical offsets from the edges) so that they can be drawn at different sizes without distorting the edges. The following example creates a resizable texture of a button and then draws it four times with different sizes:

```C#
ResizableTexture button = Engine.LoadResizableTexture("button.png", 20, 20, 20, 40);
Engine.DrawResizableTexture(button, new Bounds2(10, 40, 50, 80));
Engine.DrawResizableTexture(button, new Bounds2(70, 20, 100, 60));
Engine.DrawResizableTexture(button, new Bounds2(180, 10, 70, 100));
Engine.DrawResizableTexture(button, new Bounds2(260, 30, 120, 90));
```
